# FunctionsValidationFilter

Load FluentValidation rules at runtime and it decorates the schema generator with all rules that can be translated in the OpenApi spec.

## Motivation

Currently, the Spec generator in the Microsoft library is not open for extension but there is already an open PR to allow for this. If it doesnâ€™t get merged, it will require working with a fork or internal package.
Azure/azure-functions-openapi-extension#344

Rules can get tricky to convert and there are hard to solve problems (e.g. translating regex dialect) so we should take a pragmatic approach of including only what is easy to port programmatically, otherwise, a manual approach would be better (eventually this could become a validation library to check that most of the rules in the spec match the one in FluentValidation to avoid rules getting out of sync).

## Quick Start

Add to your OpenApi configuration:

```csharp
DocumentFilters.AddFunctionsValidationFilter<Startup>();
```

## Usage

In your custom object to define the OpenApi configuration, use `AddFunctionsValidationFilter` on the `DocumentFilters` property.

```csharp
public class OpenApiConfigurationOptions : DefaultOpenApiConfigurationOptions
{
    public OpenApiConfigurationOptions()
    {
        // Add all validators via reflection.
        DocumentFilters.AddFunctionsValidationFilter<Startup>(services =>
        {
            // Add dependencies required to build the validators.
            // Note the OpenAPI generator doesn't use the DI container.
            services.AddSingleton<IClock>(SystemClock.Instance);
        },
        options =>
        {
            // If any operation has query string parameters that you group into an object and use a validator,
            // add it here using the operation id specified for that function endpoint with [OpenApiOperation(operationId: nameof(MyOperation))]
            options.Operations.Add<MyRequestModel>(nameof(MyOperation));
        });
    }

    public override OpenApiInfo Info { get; set; } = new()
    {
        Version = "v1",
        Title = "NewDay ðŸ¥³ API"
        // something else
    };
}
```

## Advanced Usage

If you are not using DI in Azure Functions or using static Functions, you would need to manually register all the validators you are using.

```csharp
public class OpenApiConfigurationOptions : DefaultOpenApiConfigurationOptions
{
    public OpenApiConfigurationOptions()
    {
        var builder = new FunctionsValidationDocumentFilterBuilder();

        // register a validator
        builder.AddValidator(new MyValidator());

        // register an operation which has query string parameters that you group into an object and use a validator,
        // add it here using the operation id specified for that function endpoint with [OpenApiOperation(operationId: nameof(MyOperation))]
        builder.AddOperationSchema<MyRequestModel>(nameof(MyOperation))

        var filter = builder.Build();

        DocumentFilters.Add(filter);
    }

    public override OpenApiInfo Info { get; set; } = new()
    {
        Version = "v1",
        Title = "NewDay ðŸ¥³ API"
        // something else
    };
}
```
